Regular functions in Python execute from start to finish, returning a single result using return. They store all results in memory at once, which can be inefficient for large datasets. In contrast, generator functions use yield to produce values lazily, one at a time, preserving their state between yields. This makes them more memory-efficient, especially for large or infinite sequences. Regular functions are ideal for straightforward computations, while generators are better for iterative tasks and large data processing. Generators return an iterator that yields values on-the-fly, enhancing efficiency and performance.
